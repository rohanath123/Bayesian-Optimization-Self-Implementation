# Bayesian-Optimization-Self-Implementation

Bayesian Optimization is a powerful optimization algorithm used to optimize black box functions (i.e. functions whose definitions or metadata are not known).
Bayesian Optimization is ideal when the function to be optimized is:
1. a blackbox function
2. costly to sample and evaluate. 

This means that we do not know anything about the function implementation, and evaluating the function and getting results from it is a costly task, 
which means it may take a lot of time and/or other resources.
bayes_opt1.py is my implementation of Bayesian Optimization for a test function. While the function itself is quite simple and easy to manually optimize with other
algorithms (like gradient descent), remember that it is only a function to display the working and implementation of BO. 
The output should be the best result.
